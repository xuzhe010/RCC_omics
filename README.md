# RCC_omics
This repository contains scripts and workflows related to "Extrachromosomal miRNA-gene amplification contribute to renal cancer phenotypes". It includes pipelines for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization, designed to ensure reproducibility and facilitate further research.
## Data and Analysis Workflow

The analytical workflow consists of the following major steps:

1. **Data Preparation** — Quality control and alignment of raw sequencing data;

2. **Variant Detection and Annotation** — Identification and annotation of structural variants and copy number alterations;

3. **Integration and Visualization** — Functional analysis and visualization of selected regions and genes.

The whole-genome analysis scripts used in this project are adapted from our previous repository: [CCGA_circulome](https://github.com/xuzhe010/CCGA_circulome).
Please refer to that repository for the complete implementation and detailed scripts of the genome-wide analysis pipeline.

## Environment Requirements

- Python >= 3.8  
- R >= 4.2  
- See `requirements.txt` for detailed dependencies.
